What's a view matrix (UC: viewmatrix)?
A view matrix is used in 3D programming to display "3D" objects on a 2D screen
There are multiple matrices that are used to convert game world to screen or vice-versa

Model to World matrix (model coordinates to world coordinates)
transforms vertices of model to world coordinates

World to View matrix (world coordinates to camera coordinates, moves camera around)
moves the world, the camera stays still but it seems like the camera is the one that's moving

View to Projection (world coordinates to 2d screen coordinates) matrix
makes things seem "3d"
